# Prodigybuild-vidhi-testing

Welcome to the Prodigybuild-vidhi-testing repository! Here we implement numerous numerical algorithms utilizing C++. Algorithms found within this repository include Automatic Differentiation, BBP Type Formula, Brent Salamin Formula, Discrete Fourier Transform, Fixed Point Iteration, Lagrange Interpolation, and a Random Number Generator. 

## Prerequisites

1. C++ Compiler: Ensure you have a C++ compiler in your system. We recommend using either `g++` (Mac/Linux) or `clang` compilers.

2. SQLite3: For managing any database requirements, we advise using SQLite3.

## Installation Guide

### Windows Users

To install GCC for windows:

1. Download the installer from the [MinGW-w64](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php) webpage.
2. Follow the provided instructions to install.
3. Ensure to add the path where you installed MinGW to your system path.

To install SQLite3:

1. Download the precompiled binaries from this [link](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).
2. Ensure SQLite is added to your system path.

### MacOS Users

Use Homebrew to install GCC and SQLite:

1. Open Terminal and run `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` to install Homebrew.
2. Install GCC by running `brew install gcc` in the Terminal.
3. Install SQLite3 by running `brew install sqlite3` in the Terminal.

## Compilation & Execution

To compile your C++ programs, utilize the C++ compiler (`g++` or `clang`) and the `-o` flag.
For example, to compile BBPTypeFormula:

```bash
g++ ./cpp/BBPTypeFormula/main.cpp -o bbp
```
To execute the compiled program:

```bash
./bbp
```

Follow the similar instruction for all other C++ files in this repository.

## CI/CD Integration & Deployment

In case you have a CI/CD pipeline, customize these steps according to your pipeline's requirements. Most CI/CD tools support environment variables. Therefore, remember to set up any database credentials or other sensitive data as environment variables.

## Further Assistance

Feel free to report any bugs you encounter during implementation, and we will address them promptly.
